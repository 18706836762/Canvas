Canvas
======

Canvas is a project to simplify iOS development for both designers and developers.
It had been difficult for designers to get hands on building the product with the lack of objective-c and Xcode experience, and a hard time for developer to use reasonable amount of time and lines of code just to achieve really simple effects.

With Canvas, creating stunning animations requires zero lines of code, trendy effects like the Parallex headers, Sticky sections, Blurred Backgrounds, will be as simple as few lines of code changes.


Demo App
========

The demo app in this project uses [CocoaPods][], please run `pod install` after you download this project, then open `Canvas.xcworkspace`. 

You can see the live demo by downloading this project or previewing on our [homepage][].


Getting Started
===============

If you're already on CocoaPods, installing our library is easy:

    $ edit Podfile
    platform :ios, '7.0'
    pod 'Canvas', '~> 0.1'

Make sure you also update the dependencies by running this command afterwards:

    pod install

Then you should now have the Xcode workspace (`.xcworkspace`) ready.

    $open App.xcworkspace
    
That's it and you are good to go! See our [blog posts][homepage] for hands on tutorial.
